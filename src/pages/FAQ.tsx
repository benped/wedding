                    To ensure we can accommodate all guests comfortably within the venue's capacity,
                    we ask that only invited guests attend our wedding festivities. You'll find details
                    about your party size, including whether it includes a plus one, on your invitation.
                    We appreciate your understanding and can't wait to celebrate with you!
